// C is useful for many application that had formerly been coded in assembly language.
// C produces efficient programs
// C can handle low-lecel activities
// Today C is the most popular System Programming Language.
// C was also designed to encourage cross-platform programming.
// C can be comipled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.

// C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the operating system
// C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language
// C is used in: 
// Operating Systems, Language Compilers, Assemblers, Text Editors, Print Spoolers, Network Drivers, Modern Programs, Databases, Language Interpreters, Utilities.
